This project implements a multi-threaded rocket resource management simulation. The system models various rocket subsystems that consume and produce resources, generate events, and are managed by a central manager. The simulation features:
- Dynamic memory allocation for resources and systems
- Event queue using linked lists
- Multi-threading with pthreads
- Synchronization using semaphores
- Makefile-based build system

Compilation/Execution:
To compile the program, use the following command in your terminal:

make

To execute the program, use the following command:
./p2
